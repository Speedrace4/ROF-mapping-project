# ROF-mapping-project

### Purpose:

This project was done for the Reimagining our Future UChicago class. Its purpose is to allow for easy map comparisons, and also to provide more in-depth analysis of the crime data available from the City of Chicago. Given the saying "all maps of Chicago are the same", I made this with the intention of making that direct comparison of maps much easier.
